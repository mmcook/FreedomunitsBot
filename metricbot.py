This method determines by unit which unit to convert it to, and then returns the converted 
value in a string format by calling respective functions from convert.py.
The legitimate units used in this function will be cm, inches, kg, lb, celsius, and farenheit.
If the value is not a number, it will raise a ValueError, and if the unit is not a one that
is listed above, it will raise an Exception.
Both exceptions will prevent the program from replying to said comment.
